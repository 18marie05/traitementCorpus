Background As the global climate changes in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, weather and temperature are expected to become increasingly variable. Although heat sensitivity is a recognized clinical feature of multiple sclerosis  . MS-related visits were most frequent in Minnesota, Idaho, Alabama, Maine, and Connecticut  . Anomalously warm weather occurred most frequently between October and March  . The study population  1 .  Anomalously warm weather was associated with increased risk for emergency department visits  . Using fitted models from our primary analysis, we estimated that there were an additional 1,960 outpatient . MS, multiple sclerosis; RR, risk ratio.  Secondary analyses By age group, we identified the strongest associations among individuals aged 56 to 64 years for outpatient visits  .

Association between warm weather anomalies and MS-related outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient visits by age group, 2003–2017. We used generalized linear models with the binomial family and log link specified to estimate RRs within age groups  . By contrast, we found no evidence of an exposure–response relationship between average absolute monthly temperature and MS-related visits  .

We created a range of alternative metrics for anomalously warm weather in which the average temperature exceeded the long-run average for that calendar month and county by 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0°C. We used generalized log-linear models to estimate RRs. For each visit type, the outcome of interest was a monthly indicator variable that equaled 1 if there was at least MS-related outpatient, emergency, or inpatient visit and 0 otherwise. All models were adjusted for continuous age with a natural spline and 3 degrees of freedom, sex  S2 Fig. Frequency of MS-related healthcare visits state in the Optum Clinformatics Database, 2003–2017. Shading intensity represents the percentage of person-months in which at least 1 MS-related outpatient, emergency department, or inpatient visit, respectively, for each state from 2003 to 2017 among the 106,225 patients with MS identified in the Clinformatics Data Mart Database. MS-related inpatient and outpatient claims were identified using primary diagnostic code 340 from the ICD-9 and G35 from the ICD-10. Maps were produced using publicly available US Census base maps accessed via the “usmaps” package for R Statistical Software v 4.0.0.

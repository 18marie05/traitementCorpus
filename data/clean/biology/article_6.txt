Premature termination codons . Some full-length p53 was produced from the R213X TP53 mRNA in the absence of G418, reflecting spontaneous readthrough. G418 induced PTC readthrough, as seen by the increased production of full-length p53, which reached a peak at approximately 0.3 μM. However, higher G418 concentrations reduced readthrough, to the same extent as they inhibited the synthesis of WT p53 . This result indicates that inhibition of protein synthesis puts an intrinsic limitation on the extent of PTC readthrough that can be elicited by G418, making PTC readthrough by G418 a self-limiting process.

Identification of Y-320 as a PTC readthrough enhancer It has recently been shown that PTC readthrough by aminoglycosides can be enhanced by small molecules that do not themselves stimulate readthrough when used as single agents [ 16 – 19 ]. We hypothesized that compounds might exist that overcome the self-limitation and increase PTC readthrough by G418 without further inhibiting protein synthesis. In order to discover such compounds, we assayed the Selleck bioactive library of 2658 compounds for enhancement of G418-induced PTC readthrough in HDQ-P1 cancer cells carrying homozygous TP53 R213X nonsense mutations. Cells seeded in 96-well plates were exposed to the small molecules in combination with 50 μM G418. Although much higher than the concentration active in cell-free extracts, this G418 concentration is suboptimal in cell assays as the plasma membrane imposes a strong barrier to the intracellular diffusion of the highly polar aminoglycosides. After 72 h, TP53 PTC readthrough was assessed using quantitative automated p53 immunofluorescence microscopy . The phenylpyrazoleanilide Y-320 was the strongest PTC readthrough-enhancing compound , as did cells treated with Y-320 alone . Exposure to G418 induced a low level of readthrough which was strongly enhanced by increasing concentrations of Y-320 . Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 2. Y-320 enhances PTC readthrough by G418 in different cell lines. . We similarly measured the effect of Y-320 on TP53 readthrough in H1299-R213X cancer cells, which do not express p53 because of homozygous deletion of the TP53 gene and have been stably transfected with TP53 R213X construct . No full-length p53 was detected in untreated cells or cells treated with Y-320 alone. G418 induced p53 readthrough that was considerably enhanced by Y-320 . To determine whether Y-320 can also enhance the PTC readthrough of additional genes, we next tested it in DMD patient-derived myoblasts harboring a nonsense mutation in the DMD gene . Exposure of DMD cells to G418 during the differentiation period led to some dystrophin expression and cotreatment with Y-320 enhanced readthrough 2.2-fold over G418 alone . The level of dystrophin in DMD cells exposed to 1 μM Y-320 + G418 was 1.4% of that of WT myoblasts. We also examined the effect of Y-320 on Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa . Untreated JEB cells showed no detectable signal . At 30 μM, G418 induced detectable PTC readthrough which was enhanced 3.7-fold in combination with 1 μM Y-320, to about 0.06% of levels observed in HaCat cells . These results show that Y-320 can enhance PTC readthrough by G418 in patient-derived cell types with nonsense mutations in different genes. One possible mechanism for readthrough enhancement is stabilization of mRNAs bearing nonsense mutations via inhibition of nonsense mediated decay . In combination with G418, Y-320 increased TP53 mRNA levels up to 7-fold at 2 μM compared to G418 alone , likely a consequence of increased PTC readthrough, which shields the mRNA from recognition by NMD [ 16 , 17 ]. Additionally, in the cell-free translation assay, G418 induced R213X TP53 PTC readthrough but Y-320 did not enhance readthrough , indicating that unlike G418, Y-320 likely does not directly target translating ribosomes. Effect of Y-320 on protein synthesis The increased readthrough activity of aminoglycosides has been shown to correlate with their inhibitory effects on protein synthesis . Having discovered that Y-320 can enhance PTC readthrough, we asked whether it would adversely affect cellular protein levels or protein synthesis. We examined the effects of Y-320 on protein levels using the SYPRO Ruby protein stain. SYPRO Ruby, a fluorescent dye that labels positively charged amino acids and therefore most classes of proteins in the cell, was used to quantify total cellular protein by automated fluorescence microscopy. HDQ-P1 cells were exposed to G418, Y-320, or their combination for 48 h and were fixed and stained with SYPRO Ruby and with a DNA dye to identify cells. Compared to untreated cells, 200 μM G418 alone did not significantly affect cellular protein levels . Unexpectedly, Y-320 increased cellular protein levels in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching 2.9-fold at 2 μM . The combination of 2 μM Y-320 and 200 μM G418 also increased cellular protein, to a slightly lower level than Y-320 alone . Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 3. Stimulation of protein synthesis by Y-320 and correlation with p53 readthrough at the single cell level. . To verify that the effect of Y-320 on protein synthesis was not exclusive to one cell line, we also tested protein synthesis in H1299-R213X cells and WT fibroblasts treated with Y-320 alone for 24 h. Y-320 significantly increased protein synthesis in both cell lines . These results indicate that Y-320 increases protein synthesis activity and total cellular protein levels. The enhancement of protein synthesis by Y-320 could reflect higher metabolic demand imposed by increased cell proliferation, a feature seen in cancer cells [ 24 , 25 ]. To test this possibility, we exposed HDQ-P1 cells to Y-320 for 48 h and measured cell numbers. Y-320 caused a 10% to 20% reduction in cell number . Additionally, increasing concentrations of Y-320 in the presence of G418 reduced HDQ-P1 cell viability up to 19% and 35% after 24 h and 48 h, respectively, as measured using the . Therefore, enhanced protein synthesis by Y-320 was not a consequence of increased cell proliferation. We reasoned that if a causal relationship exists between the increased protein synthesis brought about by Y-320 and its readthrough enhancement, then this correlation should hold at the single cell level. In other words, within a population of treated cells, individual cells showing higher PTC readthrough should also show higher protein synthesis. We carried out translation elongation experiments in which HDQ-P1 cells were exposed to drugs for 48 h, at which point harringtonine was added to block translation initiation, together with puromycin for 10 min. The cells were then fixed, labeled with anti-puromycin and anti-p53 antibodies, and the immunofluorescence signals were measured in approximately 2,000 individual cells per treatment using automated microscopy. The data were graphed as “lineup” plots with the cells showing lowest to highest puromycin incorporation ranked from left to right on the x axis and corresponding p53 levels on the y axis . Most untreated cells displayed similar puromycin incorporation, with a minority showing a distinctly lower or higher levels. p53 levels were low in most cells, corresponding to background immunofluorescence, except for a trend toward higher p53 signal in cells showing higher puromycin incorporation . In cells exposed to G418 alone, p53 levels were slightly higher in many cells  and there was a weak positive linear correlation between p53 levels and translation elongation which was not different from that of untreated cells . Although correlative, these results are consistent with a causal relationship between increased protein synthesis and increased PTC readthrough. Y-320 increases ribosome biogenesis The increased translation and cellular protein levels observed in cells exposed to Y-320 might reflect a higher cellular ribosomal content. To determine whether Y-320 enhanced ribosome biogenesis, we examined the expression of 2 ribosomal markers, the S40 ribosomal subunit protein rpS6 and ribosomal RNA . However, 2 μM Y-320 alone and combined with G418 increased levels of rRNA . At 24 h, 2 μM Y-320 alone also increased levels of rRNA  Ribosome biogenesis in HDQ-P1 cells. HDQ-P1 cells treated with the indicated compounds for 24 h and 48 h were fluorescently labeled using antibodies against rRNA and rpS6. Asterisks indicate values significantly different between treated and untreated cells  confirming the higher levels of protein synthesis described above. Y-320 caused a small steepening of the negative slope, indicating a trend toward increased translation rate, but this effect was not statistically significant, indicating Y-320 had a minimal effect on the translation elongation rate. Additionally, Y-320 did not affect the levels of eIF4G or the phosphorylation of eIF4B at Ser 422, two proteins involved in control of translation initiation . Next, we explored the correlation between protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis at the single cell level by exposing HDQ-P1 cells to drugs, incubating with harringtonine and puromycin, and staining the cells with anti-puromycin and anti-rRNA antibodies. Exposure to Y-320 without or with G418 increased rRNA levels in the vast majority of cells  and a positive correlation between rRNA levels and translation elongation was observed . Upon exposure to the combination of Y-320 and G418, a strong positive correlation was observed between higher levels of rRNA and higher p53 levels  signaling, a pathway known to control protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis [ 26 , 27 ]. The tuberous sclerosis complex genes TSC1 and TSC2 are negative regulators of mTOR signaling . We examined the effect of Y-320 on cellular protein and ribosomal RNA in immortalized Tsc2 −/− mouse embryo fibroblasts, which feature constitutively high mTOR activity [ 28 , 29 ]. Tsc2 −/− cells were exposed to Y-320 without or with G418 for 48 h, fixed and probed with SYPRO Ruby stain and anti-rRNA antibody. Y-320 increased levels of cellular protein and rRNA up to 4.3-fold and 3.6-fold, respectively, compared to controls . Activation of mTOR signaling leads to phosphorylation of downstream proteins ribosomal S6 kinase . These results indicate that Y-320 can increase cellular protein levels and ribosome biogenesis even in the presence of highly active mTOR signaling. Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 5. Y-320 stimulates protein synthesis independently of mTOR signaling. , as previously reported in other cell lines [ 26 , 32 ]. Next, we exposed HDQ-P1 cells to Y-320 without or with G418, together with different concentrations of rapamycin for 48 h, fixed and stained them with SYPRO Ruby or fluorescently labeled them using the antibodies against rRNA and p53. We observed that rapamycin by itself did not affect the overall protein levels, as previously described  nor did it inhibit the effects of Y-320 on cellular protein, rRNA, or p53 levels , except for a minor reduction in SYPRO Ruby staining at 10 nM rapamycin. These results indicate that inhibition of mTOR signaling is not sufficient to prevent Y-320 from increasing protein levels, ribosome biogenesis, or PTC readthrough and that the effects of Y-320 are not mediated by mTOR signaling. Effect of Y-320 on translation fidelity Given the surprising result that Y-320 increased cellular protein synthesis, we wondered to what extent this process might be dysfunctional. We assessed translation fidelity during Y-320 treatment using a set of firefly luciferase mutant reporters in H1299 cells . In these reporters, lysine 529 is mutated, leading to defective luciferase activity, and misincorporation of lysine at the mutated site results in restoration of luciferase activity. The mutations consisted of nucleotide substitution at the first . G418 alone had no effect on the frameshift mutations or on missense mutations K529E and K529I but it increased amino acid misincorporation at K529N and it induced readthrough at the PTC. Y-320 alone had no effect on any of the mutants, indicating no observable effect on translation fidelity. The combination of G418 and Y-320 had no observable effect on missense mutations K529E, K529I, or the frameshift mutants. However, the combination of Y-320 and G418 increased PTC readthrough by G418, as expected, and it also increased misincorporation at K529N compared to G418 alone . The positive control . Considering that 3 chemokines were among the 5 most up-regulated genes and the previously reported immunomodulatory activity of Y-320 , we decided to focus on these genes. CXC chemokine ligands CXCL10, CXCL8, and CXCL2 showed log 2 fold increase >3, and CXCL11 and CXCL3 showed log 2 fold increase >2 . CXCL1 and CXCL16 were also up-regulated by Y-320 although to a lesser degree . CXC chemokines are small secreted proteins that have been attributed several roles including chemotaxis in cells expressing receptors for these chemokines . CXCL10, CXCL8, CXCL2, and CXCL3 can also induce cell growth and proliferation and are putative autocrine or paracrine growth factors in cancer [ 36 – 38 ]. CXCL8, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL1 act through a common receptor, CXCR2 , which showed no up-regulation in our RNA-seq data. Download: PPT PowerPoint slide PNG larger image TIFF original image Fig 7. Up-regulation of CXC chemokines by Y-320 and effect of SB225002 on protein levels and PTC readthrough. . The increase in cellular protein levels elicited by Y-320 alone and Y-320 combined with G418 was reduced by SB225002 in a concentration-dependent manner . SB225002 also considerably decreased in a concentration-dependent manner PTC readthrough elicited by the combination of G418 and Y-320, both in the immunofluorescence assay  and by western analysis . These results indicate that the effects of Y-320 on increased protein synthesis and PTC readthrough are mediated in large part by an autocrine mechanism involving up-regulation of chemokine expression and secretion and increased signaling through a chemokine receptor. Discussion Aminoglycosides suffer several limitations as potential PTC readthrough treatments for rare genetic disorders. At the organismal level, they are known to cause oto- and nephro-toxicity via preferential accumulation and retention in cochlear cells and proximal tubule cells [ 42 – 44 ]. At the cellular level, their toxicity has been linked to damage to the lysosomal membrane following uptake by endocytosis and accumulation in this compartment [ 45 – 47 ], as well as inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis [ 12 , 15 ]. Here, we illustrate a further limitation: inhibition of cytosolic protein synthesis at the G418 concentrations that are required for readthrough. As a result, the maximum levels of PTC readthrough achievable by G418 are low, even in a cell-free translation assay, where the other factors described above are not at play. Whether inhibition of protein synthesis at concentrations that induce readthrough is due to higher occupancy of the decoding center or to binding to additional sites on the ribosome remains to be deteremined. It will likely be important to also consider this self-limiting process when developing improved aminoglycosides for readthrough therapy. Here, we asked whether PTC readthrough could be increased without further inhibiting protein synthesis by combining G418 with another small molecule. We first identified Y-320 as a potent enhancer of G418-induced PTC readthrough active against nonsense mutations in different genes and patient-derived cells of different tissue origins. When used alone, Y-320 did not increase R213X TP53 mRNA levels, indicating it is not an NMD inhibitor. The combination of Y-320 and G418 increased R213X TP53 mRNA to a higher level than G418 alone, which is likely a consequence of increased readthrough by the combination, as is the higher level of truncated p53 [ 9 , 16 ]. In the particular case of p53, which acts as a tetramer, the presence of truncated p53 has potential to inhibit p53 function by a dominant-negative mechanism [ 48 , 49 ]. The levels of full-length products induced by readthrough in DMD and JEB cells were very low compared to those of WT myoblasts and keratinocytes. However, considering the long half-lives . Moreover, cells exposed to Y-320 showed higher levels of ribosomal markers rRNA and ribosomal protein S6, consistent with stimulation of ribosome biogenesis underlying the increased cellular protein levels and synthesis. It is noteworthy that CDX5-288  and CDX6-180, two structurally distinct readthrough enhancers recently identified in our laboratory, showed no stimulation of ribosome biogenesis . To our knowledge, increased protein synthesis activity has not previously been linked to enhancement of PTC readthrough by an aminoglycoside. We were interested to determine whether a causal relationship existed between these 2 processes. This is not an easy question to address as protein synthesis is fundamentally linked to essentially all cellular activities, and it is not suited to gene down-regulation or overexpression approaches often used to validate drug targets. We first elected to verify whether the correlation observed between increased protein synthesis, increased ribosomal markers, and increased PTC readthrough observed at the cell population level also held at the cellular level, reasoning that a lack of association at the individual cell level would indicate unrelated effects. A strong correlation was observed between increased rRNA levels and puromycin incorporation, which was not surprising and indicated the additional ribosomes produced during incubation with Y-320 were functional. In individual cells exposed to G418 and 2 μM Y-320, we also observed strong positive correlations between puromycin incorporation and PTC readthrough , where misreading most often occurs because interaction at the cognate base is weaker than at the first and second positions [ 50 , 51 ]. Y-320 was discovered in a phenotypic cell-based screen as a compound that inhibited IL-17 production by murine CD4 T cells stimulated with a cocktail of IL-15, CXCL12, and anti-CD3 mAb [ 20 , 34 ]. Y-320 also ameliorated type II collagen-induced arthritis in mice and monkeys and reduced IL-17 mRNA expression in arthritic joints in mice . However, a direct target for Y-320 and its cellular mechanism of action have not been described. A recent study has shown that Y-320 can also inhibit the P-glycoprotein efflux pump and sensitize multidrug resistant tumors to chemotherapy . We examined whether the effect of Y-320 was dependent on mTOR, a major regulator of protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis. Experiments with Tsc2 −/− cells expressing high levels of mTOR activity and with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin indicated no involvement of mTOR. To further probe the mechanism of action of Y-320, we determined its effects on gene expression in HDQ-P1 cells. Our RNA-seq data showed Y-320 strongly up-regulated the expression of chemokines CXCL10, CXCL8, CXCL2, CXCL11, and CXCL3, and moderately up-regulated CXCL1 and CXCL16. Chemokines and their receptors are produced by many cells including fibroblasts, immune cells, and cancer cells. Chemokines have well established roles in homeostasis and controlling cell migration during organ development as well as leukocyte activation and trafficking during immune responses [ 35 , 53 , 54 ]. Chemokines also play roles in the biology of nonimmune cells. Chemokines expressed by cancer cells and stromal cells can stimulate tumor growth, progression and metastasis [ 35 , 55 , 56 ], and chemokines have been described as putative autocrine or paracrine growth factors in cancer [ 36 – 38 ]. To our knowledge, the effect of CXCL chemokines on ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis has not been investigated, but proinflammatory cytokines have previously been shown to increase the global translation rate in bronchial epithelial cells . CXCL8, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL1 exert their effects through the receptor CXCR2 . Here, the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 reduced the increase in protein levels and PTC readthrough caused by Y-320 and G418 while having no effect on basal protein synthesis in cells not exposed to the readthrough compounds. This key experiment suggests a model whereby Y-320, at least in part, exerted these effects in an autocrine manner through up-regulating the expression and secretion of chemokines that then bound to cell surface CXCR2 to induce an intracellular signal that increased protein synthesis and PTC readthrough. One implication of this mechanism is that pro-inflammatory signals might generally enhance PTC readthrough by an aminoglycoside. This may be relevant to the treatment of recessive dystrophic EB  and R213X TP53  S3 Fig. Y-320 does not increase COL17A1 levels in HaCat cells.
